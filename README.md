# Poker_payout_tool
Tool for calculating poker payouts between friends.
It can be very annoying when one player at the table has to be the bank i.e. the go between for money within the group.
This program allows you to enter in the buyin and buyout of each player within the game.
It will return who must pay whom within the group and eliminates the need for a middleman banker!
